## FAQ

### How do I pet the bird?

Simply move your cursor back and forth over your bird until a heart appears! You can also click the bird to open the menu and pet it from there. There may even be a slightly greater chance of finding a feather when your bird is well loved...

### How do I collect feathers?

Feathers will occasionally fall from the top of your browser window. Clicking on a feather will add a new species to your field guide, allowing you to change the appearance of your pet!

### How do I change my bird's appearance?

Once you've unlocked new species by collecting feathers, you can change your bird's appearance by opening the Pocket Bird menu (click the bird) and selecting "Field Guide".

### How do I add sticky notes?

Open the Pocket Bird menu by clicking the bird and select "Sticky Note". From there, you can add, edit, and delete notes that will stay on the page even after refreshing.

### How do I hide the bird?

Open the Pocket Bird menu by clicking the bird and select "Settings". From there, you can toggle the bird's visibility on and off temporarily on the current page.
